              <p>This was a very satisfying task. This was the first moment where we were able to create  something that didn't look like it was straight out of the 90's. It displays a couple of key skills, such as...</p>
              <ol>
                <li>My first experience with implementing Bootstrap in to design.</li>
                <li>We had to make sure that images wrapped correctly around text.</li>
                <li>Trying to mimic a website that has already been created was a great experience in finding what tools to use, even when you aren't familiar with them.</li>

            <h2>About Ian</h2>
            <p><img class="selfie" src ="img/selfie.jpg" alt="A selfie of the web developer.">I'm a web developer in training in the moment! I went to one of the most prestigious high schools in the California Bay Area, De La Salle, and landed at CSU Monterey Bay studying Visual Public Arts. After making a tough decision to leave college due to personal issues, I transferred directly in to working in museums and galleries, doing art installations and creating custom archival frames for fine art. After around 10 years of having a blast and loving the art world, I decided it's time to make a career pivot and combine my experience in design with the digital world.</p>
            <p>Favorite activities you ask? When not studying coding, I tend to be doing a few things, in no particular order...</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fly fishing. Yup, nothing feels better than being on the river.</li>
                <li>Eating Ramen. I'm a simple man, and ramen <strong>always</strong> hits the spot.</li>
                <li>Doodling. The guy sleeping in bed at the top of the page? I doodled it. It's called "Bedhead." I enjoy creating art and stickers, giving them out to friends and clients alike.</li>
                <li>Movies and video games? Yeah, we all like to remember when were a kid. These are two of the things that take me back in time like no other.</li>
